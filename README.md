# Moodify 

### Introduction
A few days ago, I delved into the concepts of REST APIs. To practice what I learned, I created a web app named **Moodify**. This app is purely built with backend technologies, including Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs, and EJS. Moodify allows users to interact with the app according to their mood.

### Features

- **Generate Random Content:** Users can generate random content based on their mood. 🔀

- **Meme Generation:** Users will be able to generate memes according to different categories. 🖼️
- **Mood-Based Songs:** Users will be able to generate songs based on their current mood. 🎼

### Technologies Used
- **Node.js:** Backend JavaScript runtime environment. 🌐
