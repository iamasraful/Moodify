# Moodify

### Introduction
A few days ago, I delved into the concepts of REST APIs. To practice what I learned, I created a web app named **Moodify**. This app is purely built with backend technologies, including Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs, and EJS. Moodify allows users to interact with the app according to their mood.

### Features

#### Current Features
- **Post on Moodify Feed:** Users can post anything they want on the Moodify feed.
- **Generate Random Content:** Users can generate random content based on their mood.
- **Generate Random Songs:** Users can generate random songs that align with their mood.
- **Download Content:** All generated and posted content can be downloaded.

#### Upcoming Features
- **User Interactions:** Users will be able to reply to, share, and analyze posts.
- **Meme Generation:** Users will be able to generate memes according to different categories.
- **Mood-Based Songs:** Users will be able to generate songs based on their current mood.

### Technologies Used
- **Node.js:** Backend JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js:** Web application framework for Node.js.
- **REST API:** Architectural style for designing networked applications.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** Templating engine for generating HTML with JavaScript.
